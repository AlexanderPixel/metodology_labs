# Quadratic equatation solver

This application can be used to solve quadratic equations. You can choose one of two provided modes: interactive or non-interactive.

Firstly, you should clone and build this project on your local machine with this script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexanderPixel/metodology_labs.git
cd metodology-labs
```

And now you can run it in interactive mode:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
Or in non-interactive mode with passing path of file with numbers in specific
format which will be explained below

```bash
python3 main.py <path>
```

Example of file content: 1 2 3\n
**Note:** Just leave only one new line instead of \n
