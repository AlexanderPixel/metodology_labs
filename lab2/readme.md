## Linked list
* [First implementation](https://github.com/AlexanderPixel/metodology_labs/commit/a9dfd1e34d4ceddc4c29f5b82be22822144058cf) singly linked circular list.

* [Second implementation](https://github.com/AlexanderPixel/metodology_labs/commit/75a9ae78cae5ede0cfc6430cc092b83d9c50948a) linked list based on build-in array class.

## Calculation of variant
Calculation variant: number of the gradebook % 4
```
1124 % 4 = 0
```

## Instruction
The project requires Python and Unittest to be installed on your machine.

Install unittest:
```bash
pip install unittest2
```

To run program:
```bash
python3 linked_list.py
```

To run tests:
```bash
python3 -m unittest test.py
```

## Conclusion
Tests saved me time when I was writing the second implementation of the list, and they provided reassurance that I had implemented it correctly. This was my first experience writing tests, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As a result, I plan to incorporate tests more frequently into my future projects.

I strongly believe that tests are an essential and integral part of any project.
